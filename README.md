# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machines
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related factors. It utilizes the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm for classification. By training the model on a dataset of diabetes-related features, it can make predictions on new, unseen data.
